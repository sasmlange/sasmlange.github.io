Usage
========

Installing
-----------

First you have to open your terminal and cd to the root directory of your project.

.. code-block:: text

    C:\jstarstuff\myproject>

The contents of your folder might look something like this:

.. code-block:: text

    myproject
        script.jsr
        ...

Now run something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    jpm install https://sasmlange.github.io/jstar_package.zip

What just happened? We used jpm to install something! Lets go over the command
part by part.



The jpm calls jpm. The install part is the type of action that jpm will do. It
can be install or uninstall. The last part is the url. This is what you want to
download.

Importing
----------

Now after you installed the package you can import it to your scripts.

Lets say that your file structure looks like this after the install of
test-package:

.. code-block:: text

    myproject
        script.jsr
        jpm
            testpackage
                config.json
                script.jsc
            ...
        ...

Now inside of your script.jsr, you can import the package like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import jpm.testpackage.script

The import command shows the path to script.jsc

Uninstalling:
----------------

Now lets see how to uninstall a package:

.. code-block::

    jpm uninstall testpackage

See how we used the package name instead of the link.
